Sports feed and odds dashboard with bet tracking and analysis tools.

## Why?
Mainly because all I do is make private project of large size and I want to have something on my portfolio. But also
because feeding sports data into a personal dashboard for lots of custom data analytics sounds challenging and useful. 

## How?
With my dashing looks and knowledge of web development

### Stack
Node, Express, React, MongoDB.
### Provider
MySportsFeeds. They are a nifty crowd-sourced sports data provider that has reasonable pricing for personal projects.
I'm currently donating about $15 a month for NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB streams with DFS and Odds data at 1 min live delay.
While anyone can use my code, it is useless without a MySportsFeeds API key with the same entitlements.
